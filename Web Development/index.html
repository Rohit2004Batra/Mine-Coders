                <h2>Productivity and safety management of coal mines</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="platform">
                <h2>All-in-One Platform</h2>
                <p>The Ministry of Coal in India has introduced an all-in-one digital platform aimed at revolutionizing
                    the coal sector by integrating resource management, transparency, real-time data analytics, and
                    stakeholder collaboration.</p>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <p>Beyond a MOC, ePortal is a complete suite of tools designed to assist Mines with case information
                    management, document handling, hearings, outcomes, financials, and more. Users can enjoy the
                    convenience of 24/7 access, electronic checks of working coal mines, and accessibility of workers
                    through the public portal.</p>
                    <br>
                         <br>
                    <p>Coal is mined commercially in over 50 countries. 7,921 million metric tons (Mt) of coal were produced in 2019, a 70% increase over the 20 years since 1999.
                        Coal in India has been mined since 1774, and India is the second largest producer and consumer of coal after China.
                        
                        Raniganj was the very first coalfield in India where coal mining started during the East India Company i.e. in the year 1774.Dhanbad is one of the oldest coal mines in Jharkhand. It is also the richest coalfield of India. It is known as the storehouse of the best metallurgical coal which is coking coal.
                        The chief producing districts of the country are Darjeeling and Jalpaiguri.</p>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <p>The two main categories of distribution of coal mines
                        a. The Gondwana Coalfields
                        Makes up 98% of the total coal reserves and 99% of the coal production in India. Coal from here is free from moisture and contains phosphorus and sulfur. 
                        
                        b. Tertiary Coal Fields-
                        Carbon content is very low but is rich in moisture and sulphur.
                        Tertiary coalfields are mainly confined to extra-peninsular regions</p>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <p>Giridih or Karbhari Coal Field 
                        Produces India's best coking coal for metallurgical purposes 
                        
                        Talcher
                        Has coal reserves of 24,374 million tonnes, and most of the coal is suitable for steam and gas production in thermal power plants
                        
                        Godavari valley
                        Contains most of the country's coal reserves, with workable collieries at Kothagudem and Singareni
                        
                        Gevra OC Mine
                        Located in Korba, Chhattisgarh, this surface mine is owned by Coal India and is the largest mine in India and Asia. In 2023, it produced an estimated 60 million tons of coal per year and is scheduled to operate until 2036.
                        
                        Jharia Coalfield
                        Located in Jharkhand, this is one of the largest areas where coal is mined. 
                        
                        Singrauli
                         Madhya Pradesh's largest coalfield</p>
                         <br>
                         <br>
                         <p>India's coal provides a unique, eco-friendly fuel source for its domestic energy market, and the country derives about twice as much energy from coal as it does from oil.</p>
