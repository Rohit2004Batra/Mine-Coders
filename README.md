Problem Statement Title:
An app and web-based software for productivity and safety management of coal mines. (PS -SIH1645)

Solution brief:
We aim to develop a web and app-based software solution for safety management in coal mines, prioritizing accident prevention and worker health. The software will also optimize the use of machinery, labour, and materials to maximize productivity.

Functionalities: -
	Simply sign in/ login on the software platform and fill up the details.
	Predictions will be systematically organized and presented in a refined manner through AI and ML. This approach will create a user-friendly environment for reading and accessing the data.
	Each tier of the system will have access to data within the limits of their designated scope.

	The platform will catalogue the experience and skills of each worker, enabling management to efficiently assign labour to tasks that align with their specific expertise.

Future Aspect: 
Business aspect- 
o	 Forming ties with other countries, particularly in industries like coal mining, involves strategic partnerships that can lead to mutual benefits in safety management, technology exchange, and productivity improvements.
Technology aspect-  
o	 Adopting automation and monitoring systems from more developed countries can improve efficiency and reduce risks in coal mines.

Technologies to be used:
•	Analysis - Microsoft Power BI, AI/ML
•	Frontend - HTML, CSS, Bootstrap3, JavaScript, React-JS
•	Backend - Express JS, node-JS
•	App Development - Kotlin
•	Framework - Jetpack Compose framework
•	Database - MySQL, SQL, MongoDB, SQL lite
